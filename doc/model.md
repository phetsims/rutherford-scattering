## Description of the Rutherford & Plum Pudding models

General:

The 'gun' on the left side fires alpha particles at the target material atoms.
The zoomed view shows the behavior of the alpha particles as the travel through the material.

Rutherford:

The nucleus in center contains a number of protons and neutrons controlled
by user interface. Changing the number of neutrons has no effect on the model. However,
changing either the number of protons or energy of alpha particles changes effects the
trajectories of the alpha particles. The details of the effects is found in
the trajectories.pdf document.

There is also a second screen that allows the user to see a 'Macro' view of the sample.  
In this view, there are a collection of nuclei and the particles will scatter off of each
of these nuclei.  The majority of particles will travel through the space without Scattering
at all.  Changing the energy or the number of protons will effect the scatter behavior, as in
the 'Nucleus' scene.

Plum Pudding:

Always contains 79 electrons which do not change in anyway. Alpha particles travel straight
through undeflected.
