## Description of the Rutherford & Plum Pudding models

General:

The 'gun' on the left side fires alpha particles at the target material atoms.
The zoomed view shows the behavior of the alpha particles as the travel through the material.

Rutherford:

The nucleus in center contains a number of protons and neutrons controlled
by user interface. Changing the number of neutrons has no effect on the model. However,
changing either the number of protons or energy of alpha particles changes effects the
trajectories of the alpha particles. The details of the effects is found in
the trajectories.pdf document.

Plum Pudding:

Always contains 79 electrons which do not change in anyway. Alpha particles travel straight
through undeflected.
