  screenSummary: >-
    On this screen, the Play Area has a source that can stream Alpha particles
    onto a thin foil. A highly magnified view of the foil is shown in an
    observation window. Sliders adjust energy of the alpha particles and the
    number of protons and neutrons comprising the atoms in the foil. The Control
    Area has radio buttons to toggle between atomic and nuclear scale views,
    buttons to pause and step incrementally through observations, and a button
    to reset the sim. Stream alpha particles to begin observations. Look for
    alpha particles and atom sliders to play, or read on for details about the
    observation window.

  atomSpaceDescription: >-
    An atomic scale view of the foil is shown. Portions of five tightly packed
    atoms are visible, with three nuclei visible in the scene.
  nucleusSpaceDescription: >-
    An nuclear scale view of the foil is shown. A single atomic nucleus is
    visible with a representative number of protons and neutrons.
